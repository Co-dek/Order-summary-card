**What I learned**
I learned how to align list items side-to-side using "Display: inline-block; property".

**Continued development**
While working on this project, I realize some areas I wish to develop to write better efficient programs.  In future projects, I’d love to develop my ability to;
•	Efficiently outline list items 
•	Build flexible layouts
•	Create better projects with fewer blocks of code

Useful resources
For thischallenge, i really didn't use any external resource. I built the solution based on prior knowledgd i had on HTML and CSS.
